# Dynamic Programming

We solve the problems by dividing the problem into sub-problems. There are two ways of doing the same:
1. **Memoization** : Top down approach. We cache the results of the expensive calculations. You start solving the problem from the top and recursively store the results.
2. **Tabulation** : It is bottom up approach. We fill up table with solutions of subproblems and use it to solve larger problems.
